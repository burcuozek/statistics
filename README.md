# ANOVA Analysis

One of the challenge in machine learning is selecting the best features to train the model. We need only the features which are highly dependent on the response variable. In model building, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) helps us to select the best features. 

An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant. In other words, they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis.

In this project, linear regression is used to train the model, ANOVA test is used to select the features.
